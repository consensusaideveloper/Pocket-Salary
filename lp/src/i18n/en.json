      {
        "question": "Does the child pay for school essentials too?",
        "answer": "No. \"Essential expenses\" like uniforms and school-required items are covered by parents. Kids only manage \"discretionary spending\" from their allowance—things like casual clothes, stationery, hobbies, snacks, and friend activities. For anything unclear, decide together in advance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if they run out of money?",
        "answer": "No emotional top-ups. Instead, they choose from pre-agreed recovery options: earn through family gigs, borrow from next year's allowance, or give up interest. Essential needs are always covered by parents, so life won't fall apart."
      },
      {
        "question": "Isn't it harsh if they fail?",
        "answer": "In this system, running out isn't a failure to avoid—it's a designed learning moment. Instead of blame, you discuss what to do next. Mistakes become material for growth, not punishment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Won't parents over-monitor?",
        "answer": "Parents act as \"rule designers and auditors,\" not surveillance. You don't micromanage daily choices—just review together once a month. Visibility isn't for control; it's for conversation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this bribe kids with money for chores?",
        "answer": "Daily chores (cleaning, laundry, etc.) don't earn money. Family gigs only pay when there's a clear outcome and value delivered. The goal isn't the money—it's understanding the link between value and reward."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the amount normal compared to other families?",
        "answer": "We don't compare across families. The allowance depends on your values and situation. What matters isn't the number—it's building better judgment over time."
