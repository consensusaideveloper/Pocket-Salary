## How It Works (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Set the Annual Budget
Discuss and agree on the yearly allowance amount together.
Kids understand: "This is what I have for the whole year."

### STEP 2: Track Spending
Record daily expenses and visualize the balance.
Learning that spending = less money, through real experience.

### STEP 3: Review Together
Monthly parent-child reviews. Not evaluation, but "strategy sessions"
to improve future decisions.
